Logan completed his masters at Brigham Young University developing tools to study the evolutionary developmental genetics of reptiles. He is broadly interested in the mechanisms of meiotic drive and how conflict has shaped the genome and the process of gametogenesis. Logan joined the Larracuente lab as a CDM graduate student in Spring 2023. Check out Logan's personal website [here](https://sites.google.com/view/loganedvalson/about).
