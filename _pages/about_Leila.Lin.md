Leila completed her undergraduate studies at the University of California, Irvine, where she investigated signatures of positive selection in genes associated with heterochromatin function across Drosophila species and explored their relationship with repetitive genomic content. Broadly, she is interested in how repetitive elements contribute to genome organization and chromosome evolution. In Spring 2025, Leila joined the Larracuente Lab as an E2G2 student, where she plans to investigate chromosome domain organization.
