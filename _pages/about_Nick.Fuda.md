Nick Fuda  received his PhD from John Lis’ lab at Cornell University in 2012. He investigated general mechanisms of RNA polymerase II transcription in Drosophila melanogaster with a particular interest in the mechanisms controlling promoter-proximal pausing. As a post-doc, he studied dosage compensation in Caenorhabditis elegans in Barbara Meyers’ lab at University of California Berkeley, investigating how the dosage compensation machinery specifically localizes to the X chromosome and how RNA polymerase II transcription is being modulated to compensation X chromosome expression. Nick is now studying the molecular mechanisms of meiotic drive as a research associate in the lab.
