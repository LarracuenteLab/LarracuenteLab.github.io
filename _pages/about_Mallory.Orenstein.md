Originally from Fairbanks, Alaska, Mallory received her B.S. at the University of Pennsylvania in 2024 in Cell and Molecular Biology, and joined the Larracuente Lab in Fall 2025. After a stint in Paul Schmidt’s D. melanogaster lab at Penn, she fell in love with the model organism and found the E2G2 program at Rochester to be the perfect fit. Her pending project will focus on the y chromosome’s ability to mediate genetic stability. Outside the lab, she loves to read and practice amateur music production.
