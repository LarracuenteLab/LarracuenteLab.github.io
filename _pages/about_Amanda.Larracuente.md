Amanda earned her Ph.D. studying Drosophila genomics and sex chromosome evolution in Dr. Andrew Clark’s lab at Cornell University. During her postdoctoral training, she focused on the evolution of selfish DNA including the Segregation Distorter system of Drosophila melanogaster. Amanda was the Stephen Biggar and Elisabeth Asaro Fellow in Data Science from 2017-2020. She became the Nathaniel and Helen Wisch Professor of Biology in 2024. Amanda is the Associate Chair of the Biology Department.

Other roles: Amanda is the advisor and track coordinator for the undergraduate major and minor in Computational Biology. She teaches the Applied Genomics capstone for comp bio majors. Amanda is also an active member of the Goergen Institute for Data Science where she advised majors and MS students and co-chairs the working group in Life and Biomedical Data Science.  Outside of the University, she is on the editorial boards for Molecular Biology and Evolution and GENETICS and was on the Board of Directors for the Genetics Society of America.
