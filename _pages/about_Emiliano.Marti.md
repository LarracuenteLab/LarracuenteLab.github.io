Emiliano got his masters at the Sao Paulo State University studying the evolution of repetitive DNA in Schistocerca grasshoppers. He is interested in repetitive elements and their role in genome organization and sex chromosome evolution. Emiliano joined the Larracuente lab as an E2G2 graduate student, and is studying the organization of satellite DNA in populations. He is co-advised by Dr. Daven Presgraves.
